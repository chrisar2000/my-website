			<h3 class=section>⍿ Brief History ⍿</h3>
			<p>
			My name is Christopher Richardson. I have been involved with technology all my life. As a young teenager I took a liking to modifying the look of my Xbox 360, taking it apart, cutting out designs in the casing, applying plexi glass and internal LED's and then piecing it back together
			was so much fun to me. I continued to involve myself with xbox 360 projects, eventually learning to solder LED's for the ROL (Ring of Light) RF board to change the ROL colors. After some time I began to realize that many of the games I were playing then just werent enough for me.
			I brainstormed many ideas thinking to myself how wonderful it would be if I could make these video games a reality. I began researching how to do so and came across Unity, I quickly realized creating a video game is no easy task, even the 2D games were hard to make!
			I spent countless years, trail & error, learning how to code, particularly in C#. Although I may not be a mastermind, I try my best to make the kid version of me happy by creating small games that I find fun. This website is a collection of the games I have made or are
			still in the process of making that I find worthy.

			<h3 class=section>⍿ Current Overview ⍿</h3>
			<p>
			I have many years of hardware and software experience under my belt. As of now, I have 0 years professionally but 10+ years personally. I can troubleshoot both hardware and software issues with computers. I am familiar with Linux aswell. I can read HTML, CSS, C#, C++, Python & Java
			yet as of now I can only effectively write HTML, CSS & C#. In regards to malware troubleshooting, I can also do that. I am familiar with RAT (Remote Administration Tools) Viruses, Key Loggers, Worms, Ransomware, and Spyware. My history with viruses stems back to when I was a teenager, I was fascinated by how they worked and had a desire to understand their inner workings. I can put together, take apart, and troubleshoot computer towers & laptops.
